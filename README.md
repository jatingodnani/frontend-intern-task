**Time: 2-3 hours**

## Task: Build a Responsive EMI Calculator Interface

**Objective:**  
Develop a responsive user interface (UI) for an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator. The interface should allow users to input loan details and display the EMI results in a clear and intuitive manner.

---

## Instructions:

### 1. User Input Form:
- Create a form that takes the following inputs from the user:
  - Loan amount
  - Interest rate
  - Loan tenure (in months/years)
  - Optional: Prepayment or extra EMI amount
- Ensure that form validation is in place (e.g., required fields, positive number inputs).

### 2. Display EMI Calculation Results:
- After form submission, display the calculated EMI, total interest payable, and total amount payable (principal + interest).
- If a prepayment is made, show how it affects the loan tenure and the total interest saved.
- Provide a **month-wise breakdown** of payments, including:
  - EMI paid
  - Interest paid
  - Principal paid
  - Remaining balance

### 3. User Experience Considerations:
- The design should be clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
- Use modern libraries or frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular (React is preferred).
- Ensure the layout works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

### 4. Optional Advanced Features:
- Add the option for users to toggle between different themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
- Provide an option to save or print the EMI breakdown.

## Requirements:
- Use **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and a frontend JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Angular preferred).
- Use **Bootstrap** or a modern CSS framework for responsive design.
- Ensure clean, maintainable code with proper comments.
- Provide form validation and clear error messages for incorrect inputs.

---

## Deliverables:
- A zipped folder containing:
  - The complete frontend project.
  - Instructions on how to run the project locally (via a README file).
  
- **Bonus:** Provide a live demo link (optional) if you host the app on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Responsive and intuitive UI design.
- Functionality and form validation.
- Code quality and maintainability.
- Bonus points for additional features like dark mode or live demo.
